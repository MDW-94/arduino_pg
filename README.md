# Arduino Playground 

A repository of all my arduino studies and sketches. Working through exapmles in books or 
elsewhere.

## General Info
All of these sketches require the Arduino IDE in order to verify, upload & run using an 
Arduino Micro-Controller.

So far these sketches are just ways for me to practice the workflow of using arduinos. I've 
uploaded them to Github to back them up/share with anyone who might be interested in looking 
through what I am currently learning. most of these examples and notes are taking from Arduino
For Musicians by Brent Edstrom.


## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo URL>
```

Open using the Arduino IDE which can be installed for free via the website - 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

You will need an Arduino Nano or some sort of Arduino microcontroller in order to upload and 
run the sketches. I have been running my sketches on an Elegoo UNO R3.
